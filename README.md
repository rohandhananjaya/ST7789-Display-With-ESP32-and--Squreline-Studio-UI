# 240x240 TFT Display (ST7789) with ESP32 WROOM, Squareline Studio UI, LVGL 9.3.0, and TFT_eSPI 2.4.43

## Project Overview

This sample project demonstrates how to configure and run a 240x240 TFT display using the ST7789 driver with an ESP32 WROOM microcontroller, with a user interface designed in Squareline Studio, rendered by LVGL 9.3.0, and driven by the TFT_eSPI 2.4.43 library. The project is intended as a reference for anyone looking to integrate these tools and libraries for rapid UI development on ESP32-based hardware.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 WROOM module
- 240x240 SPI TFT display (ST7789 controller)
- Jumper wires and breadboard (or custom PCB)

## Software Requirements
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [LVGL 9.3.0](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/releases/tag/v9.3.0)
- [TFT_eSPI 2.4.43](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI/releases/tag/2.4.43)
- [Squareline Studio](https://squareline.io/) (for UI design)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download This Project
Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

### 2. Configure TFT_eSPI
- Copy the provided `User_Setup.h.txt` to your TFT_eSPI library folder as `User_Setup.h`.
- Edit the `User_Setup.h` file if your wiring or display differs from the default configuration.
- Make sure the display driver is set to `ST7789` and the resolution is set to 240x240.

### 3. Install Dependencies
- Install the required libraries via Arduino Library Manager or manually:
  - LVGL (version 9.3.0)
  - TFT_eSPI (version 2.4.43)
- Install the ESP32 board support via Arduino Boards Manager.

### 4. Open and Upload the Project
- Open `main.ino` in Arduino IDE.
- Select the correct ESP32 board (e.g., ESP32 Dev Module) and COM port.
- Upload the code to your ESP32 WROOM.

### 5. UI Design with Squareline Studio
- Use Squareline Studio to design your UI.
- Export the UI code and replace the corresponding files in this project (`ui.c`, `ui.h`, etc.).
- Ensure exported files are compatible with LVGL 9.3.0.

### 6. Run and Test
- After uploading, your ESP32 should display the UI on the 240x240 TFT screen (ST7789).

## File Structure
- `main.ino` - Main Arduino sketch
- `ui.c`, `ui.h`, `ui_Home.c`, `ui_Home.h`, etc. - UI code generated by Squareline Studio
- `lv_conf.h` - LVGL configuration
- `User_Setup.h.txt` - Example TFT_eSPI configuration for ST7789

## Notes
- Double-check your wiring, especially SPI connections (MOSI, SCK, CS, DC, RST, BL).
- If you use a different display or ESP32 variant, update the pin configuration in `User_Setup.h` accordingly.
- For advanced LVGL or Squareline Studio usage, refer to their official documentation.
